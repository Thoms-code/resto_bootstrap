## Missions objectives

At the end of this challenge you should have improved your:

* placement of element with *Bootstrap*


## The mission

Create a repository called _restaurant-css-framework_ in which you must realise
a window web page for a restaurant. The franchise is fictive, but the type of
food (burger, pizza, asian, ...) is your choice.

The website must be *responsive*, at least for small and medium screens. It must
at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and
contact.

__Welcome__

A page with one _Jumbotron_ and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc...).

__Menu__

A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

__Pictures__

A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per
page).

__Restaurant__

A page about the restaurants (it's a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and
different schedules.

__Contact__

A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of
the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message
itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically
correct tag.

If you want to make an even more complex website feel free to try new things and
make it as beautiful as possible.

* write a good *README*
* don't use a pre-made theme
